## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- SASS, compiled with Gulp
- BEM

### What I learned

This was my first experience using Grid, so have a lot more to learn, but overall I am comfortable with the basic concepts.

I re built the mobile nav icon svg to make animations easier. The only animation that I would have been able to do with the given icons would be to fade one out and the other one in. Instead I animated the lines indiviually.

### Continued development

I need to continue learning grid and flexbox, and work on responsive devleopment. I don't feel that my css was as efficient as it could be.
